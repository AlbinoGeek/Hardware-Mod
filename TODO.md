# Hardware Mod

## SoftwareTypes

### Computers
    TODO: Add Cooling System , a replaceable system that can be either Fans, Heat sinks, Water or Nitrogen cooled; or any combination of the above.

### Cases
    TODO: Lighting and other bling.
    TODO: Fan controls

### Motherboard

### Processor

### Memory
    TODO: Create Memory as new SoftwareType
    TODO: Memory requires Motherboard features

### Storage
    TODO: SSD as entirely different category.
    TODO: SLED as entirely different category.
    FIXME: HDD should not unlock in 1970.

## PCI / PCI Express
    TODO: Add more PCI and PCI Express devices.

### Graphics Card
    TODO: Move some features to Cooling System.

### Capture Card

## PS/2 and Universal Bus

Currently there are no Universal Bus devices, but I plan to create markets for them in v0.8.  Universal Bus will be required on the Motherboard, at a version of at least the version of the device.  E.g: A Universal Bus 1 device will run on any Motherboard with Universal Bus support.

### Peripherals
    TODO: Create Keyboard (PS/2 then UB)
    TODO: Create Mouse (PS/2 then UB)
    TODO: Create Speakers (Audio then UB)

## External Peripherals

### Monitors
    FIXME: Monitor can be sold with Computers.
    FIXME: Monitor should require the correct plug / interface to be available on the Graphics Card.

# Overhaul Vanilla

The below list of TODO items are only for when I choose to overhaul the Vanilla SoftwareTypes, which will be around version v1.0 of Hardware Mod.

## PCI / PCI Express
### Graphics Card
    TODO: Later, make 2D and 3D require a sufficient graphics card.
